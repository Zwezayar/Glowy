## 🛣️ Project Roadmap – Glowy (Skincare Chatbot)

### 🎯 Goal

Build an AI-powered **skincare chatbot** that helps customers choose authentic USA-brand skincare products, answer common questions, and eventually integrate with Facebook Messenger for customer support.

---

### 📍 Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

* ✅ Set up **Streamlit app** (Glowy).
* ✅ Create initial **GitHub repository**.
* ✅ Add basic skincare Q\&A knowledge base (`skincare_data.json`).

---

### 📍 Phase 2: AI Model Integration

* [ ] Select an **open-source model** from GitHub (DistilGPT-2, LLaMA 2–7B, or similar).
* [ ] Add **retrieval system** so chatbot uses skincare Q\&A for accurate answers.
* [ ] Implement fallback responses when no match is found.

---

### 📍 Phase 3: User Experience Improvements

* [ ] Build a **clean Streamlit UI** with chat bubbles.
* [ ] Add **product recommendation logic** (e.g., sunscreen by skin type).
* [ ] Expand knowledge base with **more skincare Q\&A**.

---

### 📍 Phase 4: Deployment

* [ ] Deploy chatbot on **Streamlit Cloud** for free access.
* [ ] Test performance on desktop & mobile browsers.
* [ ] Add analytics to track questions asked by users.

---

### 📍 Phase 5: Social Integration

* [ ] Connect chatbot with **Facebook Messenger API**.
* [ ] Handle **customer chat flows** (FAQ, product guide, contact info).
* [ ] Secure hosting (Render / Vercel / custom server).

---

### 📍 Phase 6: Advanced Features (Future)

* [ ] Explore **fine-tuning** the model on skincare-specific data.
* [ ] Add **multi-language support** (English + Burmese).
* [ ] Integrate with **payment options** for product purchase.
* [ ] Add **voice assistant mode** (speech-to-text + text-to-speech).

---

📌 This roadmap is iterative: each phase builds on the last. The first milestone is to **get the Streamlit chatbot running with your skincare Q\&A**, then slowly grow toward Messenger integration and smarter AI.
